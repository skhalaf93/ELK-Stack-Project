The suspected player we deem is the rogue player is Mylie Schmidt he was at the table everytime there was a big loss at 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm and 11pm. The dealer we believe is colluding with this player
is Billy Jones. Billy jones is at the roulette table with mylie schmidt at the same dates and times when the big losses occured. 

With that being said, Billy jones and Mylie Schmidt are the primary suspects.
